# Using Machine Learning Classification to Predict Football Results


## Introduction
This Github Repository contains all of the data and code required to run my dissertation project. 
Inside the repo you will find a data folder containing all of the required english football league data necessary to run the code, a main ipynb and py file that contains all of my code written in python and the ReadMe file.
There is no difference between the ipynb and py code files, both formats were uploaded for ease of use, this project was entirely coded in the jupyter notebook IDE.

With this project I have collected the data of the top four tiers of the English leagues over the course of eleven seasons, I created machine learning models in order to answer four distinct research questions in regard to a how machine learning models are best used and which type of models are suited to football prediction.

I also compared and contrasted the different types of machine learning models that can be used to predict football results, through the use of parametric and non-parametric classification type models I explain their backgrounds, methods, accuracy results and whether or not certain models are fit to be used for football result predictions.

## Running The Code
The code contained in this repo can be used with only a few minimal changes. Once downloaded the only things required to change in the code itself is the filepaths, you must change these filepaths for finding the data as they are currently set for my local machine.
I also use quite a lot of packages in this project, if you find that you are unable to run a select part of the code, more than likely you will be required to install the package first by either pip or conda. In coding this project I used both pip and conda commands to install packages without error.

After these steps are completed you can run the code straight away, the methods for running the models and display the visualisations are already being called so there should be no issue.

## Concluding Remarks
Thank you for visting my dissertation project and have a nice day.
